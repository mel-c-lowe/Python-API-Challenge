# Python-API-Challenge
Repo to hold UMN Bootcamp homework #6, API Challenge

Tools Used:

* Python
* Matplotlib
* Citipy Library
* Jupyter Notebook

### Assignment Overview

* Create a Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world, at varying distances from the equator. To accomplish this, use a [simple Python library](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/citipy), the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api).

* Create the following scatterplots, with analysis for each.

    * Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
    * Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
    * Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
    * Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude

* Run a linear regression on each of the relationships for the Northern and Southern Hemisphere, with analysis for each.

* Create a heatmap that displays the humidity for the cities selected.

* Using a dataframe from the total cities data, create a limited dataframe of cities with preferred weather.

* Use Google Places API to find the first hotel within 5000 meters for each of the cities in the limited dataframe and plot them on top of the humidity heatmap with a pin containing the hotel name, city, and country.
